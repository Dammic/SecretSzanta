#HOW TO RUN

To begin developing the application, go to the main catalog and run:
```
npm install
```
That will install all required depencencies

As we build vendor dependencies separately from our project, you need to build them. Run:
```
npm run build:dll
```

Then to build our project files and start the server, run:
```
npm start
```

That will start the server.
